the hearts of all women throb to the same rhythmic

<p>To the women of America I dedicate this story
of the life of my Chinese friend and teacher: it is
as accurate as she with her small store of English
words, and I with my limited knowledge of her
language could make it.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">TURNING off from the Da Mou Lui or
the Big Horse Street, the name common
to the main street in Chinese towns and villages,
there is to be found, if one seeks diligently
for it, the Street of Precious Pearls.
Always it is a side street. Often it is so
narrow that two sedan chairs cannot pass.
At those times of the day when the shadows
are long there is no golden sunshine reflected
from the cobblestones that pave the street.
But I have found, for I like to visit the little
shops on side streets, that the more precious
jewels glow with a warmer brilliancy when
the day outside is dark.</p>

<p>It is the street of greatest importance to
every Chinese girl. On it will be bought her
dowry jewels. Ancient custom rules that the
betrothed bride shall convert the wealth she
inherits from her father&#8217;s household into precious
stones. And so it is here on the Street
of Precious Pearls that her inheritance is
spent, lest by bringing money, as such, into
her husband&#8217;s household she reflect upon the
ability of her new family to support her.</p>

<p>Yen Kuei Ping sat passively quiet as her
chair-bearers turned into the street at a low
spoken word from her grandmother. She
was third in the procession. Madame Yen
rode first, directly behind the house servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
who walked ahead, breaking a way through
the crowded Big Horse Street and into the
quieter Street of Precious Pearls, crying,
&#8220;Lend light, lend light.&#8221; Next to Madame
Yen came Kuei Ping&#8217;s mother, and bringing
up the rear was a fourth chair in which was
carried a distant relative, by name Chang
An, who held a place in the household a trifle
higher than that of a trusted servant.</p>

<p>Following the swaying tapestried box-like
chairs that marked the presence of her
mother and grandmother, Kuei Ping leaned
forward in her seat, peering through the horizontal
aperture in front of her with brightening
eyes. The Street of Precious Pearls was
quiet and cool. Moss clung to the bases of
buildings and the grasses that had ventured
up through the paving stones were worn away
only in a central path and in patches in front
of entrance ways. Now and then someone
came from beneath one of the heavy curtain-like
doors that closed a shop, and slipped
along the silent street, but the padded shoes
of the pedestrian made no noise on the grass-covered
stones. Here was a peace and quiet
akin to the hush of the Mission Church,
Kuei Ping caught herself thinking, and then
flushed at what she thought her irreverence
in comparing the gorgeous pageantry of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
procession as she saw it silhouetted against
the dust-dulled gold lacquer of the shops with
the aesthetic simplicity of the Chapel.</p>

<p>They had traversed more than half the
entire length of the street when Madame
Yen&#8217;s chair came to a stop before a shop with
rich filigree carvings and double entrance
doors of heavy velvet with brass frames. At
the sound of their approach, two attendants
of the door stepped forward and swung it
wide, that the chair-bearers might carry the
ladies into a tiny inner courtyard before they
need dismount, saying as they bowed, &#8220;Honorable
ladies, enter the humble shop.&#8221; Thereupon,
the narrower inner curtains of the shop
itself were held open and Madame Yen and
her relatives, bowing low, returned the formal
greeting and passed within.</p>

<p>At the entry of customers, numerous clerks
and underlings, so it seemed to Kuei Ping,
swarmed forward with greetings and formal
offerings of stools upon which to sit and with
cups of tea to drink. The head of the shop
and his partners flicked their long-stemmed
pipes from sleepy lips and rose, as though
from deep meditation, struggling a bit with
the light that would penetrate into their eyes,
even in the darkened room, as they bowed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
offering the courtesy of &#8220;the miserable place
to the pleasure of their honorable guests.&#8221;</p>

<p>The eldest among them with his own hand
took from an attendant each cup of tea as it
was brought and offered it with a low bow to
his guest. Kuei Ping, lifting her gaze now
and then from the floor, caught a glint of joy
of the coming bargain in the corners of the
shrewd old dealer&#8217;s mouth and in her grandmother&#8217;s
eyes, even in the midst of courtesy
and greeting.</p>

<p>Rich jewels were brought forth, for Kuei
Ping&#8217;s own grandfather was a well known
silk merchant and the coming alliance with an
official family was not beyond the knowledge
of Wong Lui, dealer in jewels. Madame Yen
gave but a sweeping glance to the first display
placed before her. Kuei Ping had slipped
into the background, but her mother and the
relative looked over the jewels and then up
at Madame Yen as if to agree that they were
not worthy of attention. Wong Lui held
various secret conferences with his head
clerk, and boys slipped away into dark recesses
to bring forth rarer treasures. Madame
Yen and her daughter preferred pearls,
and from the mysterious caverns of the shop
they were brought. Exquisite gems, each
wrapped separately, were removed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
their covers and glowed in a wondrous heap
on the dark velvet cover of the teakwood
table.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping liked rich warm color but she
liked it best subdued in the luminous pearls.
She was a favorite with her grandmother
and this preference was no secret to Madame
Yen who placed her chair now, as the hour
grew on, that Kuei Ping might get the full
value of the beauty of the fabulous heap.
Carefully, one by one, the preferred gems were
separated from those of lesser beauty by the
two women. And still at intervals, as though
he had just awakened to some almost forgotten
knowledge, Wong Lui would cease caressing
his drooping moustaches with his slender
hands and wave a clerk away to bring even
rarer treasure.</p>

<p>But all things come to end in time and
these mysterious errands grew farther and
farther apart and finally ceased. Wong Lui
had placed his best before them. Kuei Ping
from under her modestly lowered lashes
caught glimpses of bright eyes that glowed
from the darkness of the inner rooms, the
curious little clerks and underlings who
peered through the dividing parchment,
eagerly following the tableau in the center of
the shop.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Not until the selected heap was before her
did Madame Yen speak of price and then only
as a question. Kuei Ping had seen her grandmother
bargain before and so she scarce drew
her attention away from the lustrous heap of
jewels even to listen. Wong Lui, too, was
seasoned at the game which both dearly loved
and so with the skill of chess players they
moved slowly, each toward his goal, each
carefully measuring the other&#8217;s power to yield
from his quoted price. At intervals, when
the conflict might have grown a trifle sharp,
cups of tea were served.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping, resting her eyes upon the pearls
so soon to be hers, drank deep draughts of
their beauty. Impelled by their drawing
power she gathered a handful of them up in
her soft pink palm, unmindful of the bargainers
but not unnoted by them. The quick
eyes of each had counted the number and the
face of Madame Yen had softened as she
looked upon the girl. Wong Lui had noted
that also and put it down in his favor in the
game before them.</p>

<p>The girl, holding the jewels thus in her
hand that she might feel their nearness, saw
them glow into warmer color as she held
them, as though her touch breathed life into
them. In after years she was to think often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the care with which they had been selected
and to pay homage in memory to the experience
and knowledge which made possible that
rare power of choice, for even Wong Lui,
seasoned dealer in jewels, had shown respect
for Madame Yen&#8217;s judgment.</p>

<p>With a suddenness so abrupt as to make
her feel she must have jerked physically, Kuei
Ping was back in memory, as she was so
often these days, at the little mission school
where she had been sent when she could go no
farther in lessons with her brothers at home.
This too had been an indulgence upon the
part of her family, gained by her nearness to
her grandmother.</p>

<p>It was graduation day. This was the
memory she conned over most often. Kuei
Ping had stood first in her class and when the
exercises were over she had stolen away into
the garden to bid it a last farewell, with the
small remembrance reward that had been
given to her clasped in her hand. Ever since
that day Kuei Ping had worn it next to her
heart. She could feel its hard edge now as
she sat holding the pearls. In memory the
fragrant perfume of the la France roses at
the end of the walk drifted out to her again,
she recalled the crunching sound Miss Porter&#8217;s
stiff foreign shoes had made as she came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
down the path, and the tenseness of the principal&#8217;s
voice as she had spoken, asking Kuei
Ping to come and sit in the arbor and talk
with her.</p>

<p>From the first day Kuei Ping entered
school she had worshipped the tall golden-haired
American girl in the shrine of her
heart as an Angel of Freedom. While they
sat in the arbor she had held Kuei Ping&#8217;s
hand in the foreign way. Kuei Ping thrilled
to the memory of that touch more than to the
glow of the pearls. Miss Porter built for the
girl who listened at her side that afternoon,
a dream bridge of words that connected the
road of Kuei Ping&#8217;s life with that strange
land called the United States, where men and
women had equal opportunity, and from
which the Chinese girl with her brilliant mind
trained to new ways might return to give
service to her own country women. Kuei
Ping had held her breath lest she lose a word
while Miss Porter talked, quiet at first, carried
away by the marvel of the opportunity,
then very still because she knew its impossibility.
For at the spring holidays Madame Yen
had told her granddaughter of the plans for
her marriage and had given her the engagement
gifts from the Chia household that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
been kept these two years now, waiting until
she should be finished with school.</p>

<p>Her family loved her. Kuei Ping had
known that from the first moment she opened
her eyes and smiled into her mother&#8217;s face.
They awaited her return home and her fulfillment
of their plans for her. There were ties
that bound her a part of the whole which
made up the unit of her family, bonds that
could not be pushed aside with the brusqueness
that made possible the spirit of freedom
that lit the eyes of the American girl. And
yet it was this spirit of freedom and of service
in the wider ways of life to which she had
built the secret shrine within her heart. It
was a hard conflict, but Kuei Ping&#8217;s decision
was reached before she had lifted her quiet
eyes to thank Miss Porter and say that she
could not go.</p>

<p>The latter had been a trifle curt. Kuei Ping
had wept bitter tears over it since, because
she had failed the person she admired most
in all the world. The utter futility of attempting
to make East and West understand
each other had stilled her lips from any sharing
of her feeling about her home, or any
repetition to her grandmother of the conversation
in the garden. The engagement bracelets
in the bureau in her mission school room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and the silver honor medal beneath her dress
were each sacred things that belonged in
separate parts of her life.</p>

<p>Madame Yen reached over now to Kuei
Ping for the pearls she had taken from the
table, that they might be put in the same case
with the others. The bargain was closed.
Fresh cups of tea were brought forth and refused,
Madame Yen and her relatives saying
over and over as they were bowed out, &#8220;We
have squandered your valuable time,&#8221; and
Wong Lui and his attendants begging them
not to waste their breath in courtesy for his
humble shop.</p>

<p>Outside, the chair-bearers, trained to patience
by long hours, waited.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN Kuei Ping was a child of six,
playing at games with the little cousins
who dwelt in the Yen compound, or teasing
to learn to read with her brothers, soothsayers,
upon examination of a document from
the house of Chia, had found that her destiny
was entwined with that of Chia Fuh Tang,
ten years her senior. With care the grey old
man, whose judgment Madame Yen trusted,
had taken the card upon which were drafted
the eight characters indicating the year, the
month, the day, and the hour at which Fuh
Tang had entered the world and, comparing
them with the similar characters of the girl,
had returned a favorable report of the auspiciousness
of the union. With deliberation
and due patience he had compared the combination
of their characters with each of the
five elements, metal, wood, water, fire and
earth, to make sure that in the proposed marriage
there was no destroying omen such as
the uniting of wood and fire. He next discovered
that the two cyclic animals that had
presided over the birth of the youthful couple
were not at variance with each other.
Thereon it was ascertained that the two
would abide together in harmony.</p>

<p>Later, the Imperial Calendar being consulted
as to the black and yellow days which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
would govern the lives of the two, a second
document was sent from the house of Chia,
informing the family of Yen that the fourteenth
day of the month had been found to be
the day most favorable to the conclusion of
an engagement and asking that, if found
agreeable to them, a return document, setting
the month, be returned. Fate had already
decided the month as the second of the Chinese
calendar year by causing the girl to be
born under the sign of the tiger. The culmination
of the alliance had waited but the
year to be set by the contracting families as
the eighteenth spring of Kuei Ping&#8217;s life.</p>

<p>The month, corresponding to April on the
western calendar of that year, came with a
touch of summer on its breath. Soft rains
fell early. From the wind-dried earth sprang
a carpet of velvety green. By the middle of
the month brown-green orchids had pushed
out to the light, azaleas and the wild wisteria
were opening buds, the yellow mustard scattered
gold over the country-sides, and the
southeast wind was languid with the sickening
sweet perfume of the purple soi bean.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping, wearing the heavy wedding garments
in which she had been dressed, felt near
to suffocation in the close room. Yet she
shuddered as from a chill when Chang An,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
having put the finishing touches to the married
way of hair-dressing, placed the vanity
case before her, urging the girl to teach her
own fingers the arrangement.</p>

<p>The old woman felt the shudder and the
tense strain of the girl&#8217;s body as she fastened
the tiny buttons of the collar of Kuei Ping&#8217;s
dress. Looking down at her she said tenderly,
&#8220;Be not alarmed, little flower of our
hearts. Thou needest have no fear. Look
but into the mirror at thy beauteous face before
the veil is dropped over it. What man
living could pass by the fire of thy deep eyes
untouched! Look now, as I hold the veil of
pearls before thy eyes, and see that they out-rival
the lustre of the gems. Even thy hands
are shaped like the petals of the new opened
lotus, and thy grace is as exquisite as that of
the wind-swayed blossom. Take the incense
burner and make thy heart a lake of peace
upon which thy beauty may float with the
serenity of the flower thou dost resemble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuei Ping, gazing deep into the mirror as
into a wondering dream, reached out her
hands for the many-wired burner Chang An
brought ere she left the little bride alone.
Slowly, one by one, the girl smoothed out the
twisted curves until the interlacing grooves
were one continuous whole in which the incense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
burned before the Goddess of Mercy
without a break.</p>

<p>The hours hung heavy upon her. Over the
door that closed her from the feasting came
stray bits of gossip. She heard the click of
ivory dominoes as the dowagers gambled at
sparrow. The plaintive call of stringed instruments
came to her as from a great distance.
Now and then, as a minstrel took up
the refrain, she caught the words of some old
love song, or heard repeated in chant the
valor of a departed family hero.</p>

<p>The clamor outside grew greater and then
subsided into the murmur of conversation.
The one o&#8217;clock feast had passed. The
shadows of late afternoon sank into darkness.
A servant came to light a taper beside her
mirror. Chang An returned and put the
finishing touches to her toilet. Her mother
wrapped the long band of red satin around
her head over the new hair arrangement
signifying that they bound her to the will of
the family to which they sent her. Madame
Yen with loving fingers placed the inner veil
of red chiffon and then dropped over it the
veil of pearls that had come the day before
from the bridegroom. The long strip of red
silk carpet was laid by servants that she might
go to kneel before the family altar and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
be placed in the waiting sedan chair without
touching her feet to the polluting ground.</p>

<p>The time of departure was near. The
rooms and courtyards in which she had lived
were strangely unfamiliar with their elaborate
decking in honor of the event. Heavily
veiled and her eyes lowered, she felt rather
than saw the crowded mass of her relatives.
The minstrel took up the wail of separation
and loss. She heard the tossing of the four
cakes which were to bring luck to her family,
and the rattle of the sieve placed over her
wedding chair to ward off evil spirits as she
was sealed into it.</p>

<p>The journey which she must make in darkness
began. Ahead of her, almost a mile
long, the procession of her attendants went.
Sitting strained and still she could hear the
clash and clang of brass cymbals, the shifting
of burdens from tired shoulders at regular
intervals, and now and then, as she strained
her eyes, the flare of waving torches. Half
way to the end of the tiring journey the noise
increased, and she gathered that they had
been met by members of the bridegroom&#8217;s
family. Dull red balls of light swung above
the entrance gates. Her chair was borne
through the double rows of the procession
which had preceded her and set down in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
reception room. She heard the murmuring
words of good omen uttered as she was
helped from her cramped seat and out onto a
second strip of red carpet that led to the part
of the compound that was to be hers.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping saw Chia Fuh Tang for the
first time in one swift stolen glance from behind
her veil. He stood with his back to her
as she entered the doorway. In that glance
she knew that he was taller than her father,
that he wore a long mandarin garment with a
square of heavy embroidery in the center of
the back, over which a black queue hung; she
saw the flash of a jewel in the front of his hat
as he turned toward her. Then she must
lower her eyes to the floor where his dark
slippers made a spot of contrast with the
bright carpet.</p>

<p>He came forward to meet her. Kuei Ping,
hidden beneath the concealing veils, was led
forward a few steps by her attendants. Then,
as custom dictated, both sat for a few minutes
side by side. Kuei Ping, still wrapped in the
long veil that reached to the hem of her wedding
garments, too weary to stand alone,
leaning upon Chang An and another attendant
was then led forth to kneel with Fuh
Tang before the family altar in worship of
heaven and earth and to make low obeisance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
before the Chia ancestral tablets. Here
Chang An lifted the edge of her veil that she
might drink with the bridegroom from a goblet
of wine ere she was led back into her room
to dress for the wedding feast.</p>

<p>Her tired nerves seemed almost to snap at
the continued twang of the stringed instruments.
Chang An cooled her hot brow with
calming hands as she took away the heavy
veils and helped to dress her in the lighter
dainty pink garments from her trousseau
chest. And Kuei Ping, remembering that
Madame Yen had told her that Fuh Tang
too had attended a foreign school, and the evidences
of ill ease he had shown in the ordeal
that had passed, wondered whether he knew
of the western custom of personal choice, and
stilled her own trembling with the realization
that he had not seen her as yet.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang saw her first thus, with tenderness
and something akin to pity in her eyes,
when he came to sit and wait for the serving
of the feast. Food was placed before them
but custom forbade the bride to eat or sleep
for three days. She must sit with downcast
eyes, her face immovable while the feasting
about her went on, the target of all eyes, the
subject of ribald jokes. Long hours passed
again in which she had need of all the patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
gained with the little incense burner.
They left as a memory the odor of heavy
perfume that came from hot rooms, the clatter
of chopsticks and bowls, the glimmer of
many-colored robes and the glitter of jewels
of the men guests, strangers and relatives,
who came in an almost ceaseless stream during
that first twelve hours to gaze upon the
beauty of the bride. Their remarks burned
as a searing iron across her consciousness.</p>

<p>Two more days the feasting lasted.
Women kinsfolk of the family who had not
met together for many months, gossiped and
drank tea, adding color to the women&#8217;s side
of the large compound with their rich garments
of brocade and satin. Some of them
swayed on small bound feet with a &#8220;golden
lily&#8221; glide. They went about examining the
chests of wedding gifts, commenting upon the
hundred and twenty boxes filled with garments
and linens, discussing the charms put
here and there to bring good luck.</p>

<p>In the other side of the vast dwelling place
the men drank wine and made merry, their
long-skirted garments of silk in seafoam
green and saffron and deep blue, and their
chains of amber and jade and the settings of
diamonds and pearls on their hands and in
their hats outdoing the vivid glory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
women&#8217;s dress. Here Fuh Tang went at intervals
to offer hospitality in food and wine,
and to joke with his guests.</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day Kuei Ping
came forth to find the guests for the most
part dispersed, to worship at the ancestral
tablets with her husband, to make low obeisance
to her honorable new mother and father
and the elder relatives, and to show her
respect before the household Kitchen God.</p>

<p>Thus Kuei Ping became an integral part
of the family of Chia.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">MOONLIGHT on which the white magnolia
flowers floated as birds about to
take wing, filled the courtyard and touched the
town with a magic of pale green gold. Kuei
Ping could not sleep. She lay wide-eyed, following
the pattern that a moonbeam made as
it filtered through the parchment window.
Unable to resist longer the call of the path
of light she slid from her bed to the floor.
Cautiously pulling about her the long garment
that lay waiting for the morning, she
crept through the door of her pavilion into
the courtyard. Still holding her slippers in
her hand she listened for sounds of others
awake. From the rooms of her honorable
women relatives came only the rhythmic
breathing of deep sleep.</p>

<p>She passed safely out of the women&#8217;s division
of the compound, stealing through the
intricate lacery of courtyards and curious-shaped
gateways, stopping to dabble her fingers
in the waters of a fountain and then, at a
disturbed quack from the pet heron who
stood sleeping with one foot drawn up beneath
him, she sped carefully away. Her
shadow mingled with that of the flowering
magnolia trees as she slipped from place to
place like a long-caged bird trying its wings
in newly gained freedom, stooping now over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the fragrant heart of a rose, brushing gently
the stiff little potted evergreens that stood in
a row at the base of the spirit screen, turning
back to feel the velvet of the purple iris, holding
up her hands to let the full-blown wisteria
petals flutter through them.</p>

<p>From over the walls came a mysterious
groping after expression from the strings of
some blind wandering musician. It vibrated
on the heart of Kuei Ping, calling her beyond
the confines of the compound she had entered
as a bride two months earlier. Square across
the entrance gateway, placed so that evil
spirits flying in to bring disaster would be
flung back, stood the high, many-colored spirit
screen guarding the household, while it slumbered,
from disaster. Her hand still touching
the familiar potted trees on the inner side
of the screen, Kuei Ping crept around it. No
sound save that of irregular snoring came
from the gatekeeper&#8217;s house. Her fingers
trembled as they sought for the open link in
the chain that held the bar across the outer
gate. A wild rose that had clambered up
beside the gateway and dared to cross the bits
of broken glass that made more impassable
the top of the wall gave her courage. Noiselessly
she slid the bar and stood without the
compound.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>How soft the dust felt beneath her feet as
they touched it for the first time. Pilgrimages
she had made with her honorable
mother-in-law to pay respect to the ancestral
hall, to worship at the temple of Buddha, and
to ask after the health of Madame Yen and
her household, but it was not fitting that the
new bride should soil her feet upon the common
ground. Chair-bearers came within the
courtyard to bear her forth upon those
journeys.</p>

<p>Leaning back against the wall, Kuei Ping
drew a deep breath of air. Now near and
now far away the music called. Thither
along the road to his former place in the
world of other affairs Fuh Tang had returned
six days after their marriage. Above her
head the wood-rose nodded in the breeze.
Men went out and beyond. Women in that
far-away land from which Miss Porter came,
walked, too, in similar paths of freedom.</p>

<p>She looked up at the venturesome rose. It
wafted down fragrant perfume. On her
questioning mind came a consciousness of a
change in the music&mdash;loneliness and a vague
hunger that died away in a vibration of despair.
There came upon the heart of Kuei
Ping an overpowering sense of walls that
stretched along the dusty hutung, closing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
upon the lives of uncountable women. Even
the roots of the wood-rose held her body
within the compound. With cold hands and
eyes blinded by tears she put the bar back in
place. Her feet caught in the skirt of her
long mandarin robe as she stumbled back into
her room.</p>

<p>The morning would bring its round of
regular hours in which she, the wife of the
eldest son, would continue her lessons in family
duties, ready to take the burden when it
should fall from the ageing shoulders of
Madame Chia.</p>

<p>The noon of the day brought its difference.
Kuei Ping sat on the folded rug at the feet of
her new mother, putting tiny stitches in a
piece of satin embroidery, when the sounds of
welcoming voices came from the outer court.
The women&#8217;s conversation about small household
affairs was stilled as they heard the gateman
repeating the name of Fuh Tang, and
the other servants take up the cry, &#8220;You
bring us unexpected joy by your presence,
most gracious master.&#8221; A needle prick from
which a drop of red blood stained Kuei Ping&#8217;s
embroidery was the only trace of excitement
the quiet little bride showed as she rose to
greet him with his mother. Within her there
fluttered a hope that he had come upon this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
unexpected visit in answer to a call from her
heart. She breathed a prayer of thanksgiving
to the Goddess of Merciful Gifts that she
had been given patience to perform the tasks
of the day in quietness, and that she had
donned for the afternoon the most becoming
of the wisteria silk garments from her trousseau
chests. The wistful light in her eyes
changed to one of sure gladness as they met
his. She heard the explanation of his coming
as put into words to their most gracious
mother, but Kuei Ping knew without words
that he had come because he loved her.</p>

<p>Throughout the week and on into the next
Fuh Tang lingered. The full moon had become
a waning quarter, making the lighting
of the many-colored lanterns in the courtyard
necessary to turn it into a fairy land at twilight
time. A messenger came calling him
back to his post, and Madame Chia, fearing
family dishonor, urged upon her son the
necessity for immediate departure as soon as
the next day should dawn.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping, bringing back to the gracious
mother the household keys with which she
had been entrusted to dole out the next day&#8217;s
supplies to the cooks, heard the last words
of Fuh Tang&#8217;s reproval.</p>

<p>It was in the courtyard, where the scattered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
petals of the blown magnolia flowers
were bruised under their feet as they walked,
that Fuh Tang told Kuei Ping that he must
return upon the morrow to his waiting work.
His voice had trembled as he spoke, and Kuei
Ping, crushing consciously beneath her tiny
embroidered slippers the blossoms that had
seemed to dare to float out to freedom and
then had dropped in a withered mass on the
paved courtyard, had begged him to let her
go with him. He had stayed his steps,
startled at the suggestion. His calm hands
folded into opposite coat sleeves, he had
listened with ears that could not believe they
heard aright.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang did not depart when morning
came. The orders of an Emperor waited.
The elders of the two august families of Yen
and Chia met together to bring wisdom to
the minds of the two young people who contemplated
so drastic a departure from family
custom. Separately and together they were
called before the family tribunal. Faithfully
and completely until now both of them had
submitted to the rules of tradition; mechanically
and faithfully they performed the small
duties given them now. Kuei Ping listened
to the daily words of her grandmother with
reverently bowed head and modestly lowered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
eyes. Words were futile, for no one among
the women spoke to let her know if by chance
they understood.</p>

<p>In humiliation Kuei Ping&#8217;s heart was
lighter than ever before. She knew that Fuh
Tang would not depart without her. His
younger brother was dispatched to fill Fuh
Tang&#8217;s too long neglected orders.</p>

<p>In early autumn they left the protection
and the guidance of their families in disgrace.
Love for each other, so strong that it broke
down old barriers to personal freedom, set
them out upon the road of life a unit separate
from the complex life of the compound. Fuh
Tang, appealing to the principal of the school
he had attended, secured through him a position
as clerk with the British consul at Peking.</p>

<p>In the Tartar City just west of the entrance
to the Forbidden City they found a small
dwelling place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>


<p class="drop-cap">FROM the time of Kuei Ping&#8217;s earliest
memory she had known that among her
people the crown of womanhood was the
bearing of a son who would perpetuate the
name and the virtue of his ancestors. Feeling
the first stirring of a new life entrusted
to her, she was filled with joy in the privilege
that was hers, a joy that was at times almost
overpowered by the fear that she might fail
in fulfillment of that trust. Daily she went to
the temple of the Merciful One begging the
Goddess of One Hundred Children to grant
unto her a male child.</p>

<p>Other women waited in the temple also for
their turn within the prayer gate, buying faggots
of incense to burn before the altar, dropping
gifts of money and touching infants&#8217;
shoes to the hem of the Goddess&#8217; robe. At
times, in these new days of life in the small
courtyard where Fuh Tang had founded their
home, her thoughts turned to those earlier
teachings in school, precepts from the foreign
Bible. Kuei Ping had even whiled away idle
hours, while she waited for her husband&#8217;s
return from his duties as clerk, by reading the
translation her teacher had given her. But
now in her time of greatest need she turned
back to old familiar ways of worship through
which her mother before her had reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
toward an unknown power, behind the wall
of earthly life.</p>

<p>Carried by the devious ways of tongue
and ear, by which news can travel the length
of an empire without need of telephone
wires, the knowledge of Kuei Ping&#8217;s hopes
reached the heart of the Yen compound.
One morning as she walked with Fuh Tang to
the outer gateway, Chang An stood requesting
admittance from the gateman. She offered
no explanation of her coming save that Madame
Yen could no longer give her shelter
and that she had come to them for a roof.
Thus without loss of face on the part of her
elders Kuei Ping was given the comfort of
an older woman.</p>

<p>Under the busy fingers of the two the garments
prepared for the child grew to a needlessly
large heap. Kuei Ping, eager in her
preparation, made tiger caps and sewed bright
buttons like eyes in the toes of shoes that she
knew in her thoughtful moments were in sizes
large enough for walking children. Chang
An gave suggestions as to the cutting of innumerable
padded coats and long hooded
caps for winter, and for the scanty garments
of bright red for summer. Together they
made ready the cradle of peach wood that the
child might be rocked safely into a long life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>Twice during the last days of waiting Miss
Porter, visiting a friend in the city, came to
call upon Kuei Ping. Once the friend, a mission
doctor, had accompanied her. This accounted
for the stiff white foreign skirt that
fluttered before her eyes as Kuei Ping struggled
back to a full consciousness of the room
and its surroundings.</p>

<p>No joy in anticipation had prepared the
young mother for the wonder of the babe as
it lay nestled within her arm. Watching with
languid eyes the quick deft movements of the
foreign woman as she made the bed more
comfortable, and beyond her the familiar
figure of Chang An lighting the tapers of the
Lamp of Seven Wicks to warn disaster from
the new-born son, Kuei Ping slipped into a
dream in which her child grew up to see both
East and West and interpret the best of each
to the other.</p>

<p>The months that followed were rich in
happiness. Winter melted into spring.
Flowers bloomed in the courtyard. Street
vendors came each morning with great
bunches of long-stemmed violets. On starlit
evenings Fuh Tang carried his little son out
into the courtyard where they sat talking of
their happiness and his future.</p>

<p>It was on a late afternoon when fruit hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
ripe on the hawthorn trees, and soft autumn
breezes swayed the leaves of the moonflower
vine that the sturdy baby made his first attempt
to walk. Fuh Tang and Kuei Ping,
both leaving him to stand in Chang An&#8217;s
hands, moved away, a double inducement for
him to take his first step. Intent upon the
child they did not hear the sound of a guest
entering the courtyard gate. Daring at last
to make the venture, the baby toddled into
Fuh Tang&#8217;s outstretched arms, and it was not
until he stood holding the child that they perceived
their aged father, Chia Sung Lien,
looking in upon them.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang, going each day to his duties at
the office of the British consul, brought back
news of the events of the outside world, but
Kuei Ping, her life full to overflowing in her
love for her husband and child and occupied
with the tasks of making the slender income
supply the daily needs of the household, had
scarce realized that men outside were at war.
The news that the father bore them brought
close the realization. Fuh Tang&#8217;s only
brother, dispatched more than a year ago to
fill his place in ignored orders, had fallen in
battle under General Tso in a vain attempt
to defend the city of Pingyang from the
Japanese.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>The aged man&#8217;s eyes followed hungrily the
movements of his sturdy grandchild, while
they brought him a chair and tea and offered
the courtesies due to age from youth. He
took from his pockets gifts to the little son
who held out his baby hands, unafraid, to
receive them.</p>

<p>When the women and child had retired
into the house and Fuh Tang sat with his
father alone in the gathering twilight the old
man spoke of the need of a man child to
carry on the traditions of the Chia household,
to give rest to the departed dead and minister
to the spirits of those who wandered in the
unknown beyond. He spoke almost with fear
of the sonlessness of the brother who had
gone, and he asked that the little grandson be
returned to his rightful place in the family
even if his parents must pursue a foolish and
selfish desire for freedom.</p>

<p>Bowed with a heavier sorrow than when he
entered, with even the shadow of dread lurking
in his eyes, Chia Sung Lien turned back
from his fruitless errand. Youth with its
new spirit of freedom had refused to place
upon the altar of old tradition its most precious
gift.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang and Kuei Ping, talking the matter
over alone, had come to know that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
believed that if their ideal for their son was
to be realized he must live his life in the freer
atmosphere of their own home.</p>

<p>Untouched by the near tragedy in the lives
of his elders, little Bo Te played happily with
the pearl charm Chang An had hung from a
silver chain about his neck.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">FUH TANG lay ill. The heaviness upon
his chest grew more and more. Kuei
Ping, straightening the fever-tossed coverlets,
knew that the charms of the medical man who
had been summoned had no power to heal her
husband. A great fear laid hold of her&mdash;a
fear that drove her out into the icy night
alone. No chair-bearer came in answer to
her frantic call and the slender means of the
household did not support a private chair.
Bending her head to break the force of the
wind she struggled somehow to the door of
the mission doctor who had eased her own
pain a year ago. With bare fists she pounded
against the gate for admittance; in staccato
breaths she cried out her need to the sleepy
gateman.</p>

<p>The old man who opened the door told her
that the doctor had been away since early
evening. Many people were ill and the foreign
doctor took no rest but he would tell her
the instant she returned.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping refused to come inside and wait.
The lonely return through the streets had no
terror for her equal to the fear that Fuh
Tang might call for her and find her gone
when he wanted her most. The doctor came
into the little courtyard, weary from a long
day and night without sleep, just as the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
feeble rays of dawn lit the sky. The doctor&#8217;s
weariness seemed to drop from her like her
outer garments as she began work upon her
patient. Noon-day showed a marked change
in his breathing and evening found him sleeping
quietly.</p>

<p>Knowledge and careful nursing brought
Fuh Tang back to life again but never again
did he recover his old strength. A slight
cough persisted long after spring was with
them and Fuh Tang had returned to his
work, a cough that grew more frequent as
summer came on. All about them men and
women and little children died of such coughs,
blinked out like candles after five or six years
of slow burning weariness. He did not speak
of it to Kuei Ping but a great dread came over
him which grew into a weariness that made
work almost impossible. He did not have the
disease, thus Fuh Tang argued with himself,
his fatigue was but the result of his long illness,
yet some foreboding kept him from
going to a foreign doctor to confirm his belief
that he did not have it.</p>

<p>It was then that he began to smoke a long-stemmed
pipe. Just a few whiffs of opium
quieted his nerves and gave him pleasant
dreamless sleep from which he woke rested
and ready for work. Upon his salary the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
daily food for his family depended. In leaving
the family compound the two had become
in reality a separate economic unit. Fuh
Tang&#8217;s earnings, plus some money he had
possessed at the time of their taking the small
home in Peking, had been sufficient for only a
very simple mode of life. During his illness
his pay had come regularly. For this Fuh
Tang was grateful, but he grew anxious lest
he be unable to perform his daily tasks.</p>

<p>At first short smokes gave him relief from
worry. Just one on the way to work in the
morning stilled the desperate growing pain
in his chest, seemed even to still his coughing.
Then as the months went by, the amount
needed for relief grew greater. He came to
have a hunted desperate look in his face if he
did not get the opium at the usual time. The
smoking made necessary his leaving home
earlier than formerly if he was to keep from
Kuei Ping the knowledge of his fear. He laid
the first stone in the barrier which grew up
between them when he did not share with her
his anxiety. Kuei Ping, carrying her second
child, was more sensitive than in normal times.</p>

<p>The frosts of late autumn had turned to
dried husks the beauty of the garden. Was
it to be so with their love which had begun
with such happiness? Thus Kuei Ping found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
herself questioning day after day. Even little
Bo Te did not seem to call unto himself as
much of his father&#8217;s attention as formerly,
yet he grew more fascinating every day, his
mother felt.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang, fighting the weariness that crept
further upon him, came to leave the shelter of
his home with a sense of relief. Outside he
could smoke and let down under the strain of
pain and the necessity to struggle against his
growing absent-mindedness.</p>

<p>Thus the first shadows of a wall of doubt
separating Kuei Ping and Fuh Tang cast their
length across the tidy courtyard of their
youthful love.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">KUEI PING&#8217;S second son lived but a few
hours. Chang, preparing the burial
rites, sobbing her grief and disappointment
even as she summoned the soothsayer to examine
the Imperial Calendar for the lucky
day upon which to place the small body in its
coffin, felt utterly baffled by the quiet passiveness
of the mother. It was to Fuh Tang that
she must turn for every decision and whom
she must help to still his grief while the message
requesting burial in the Chia family
burial grounds was written and dispatched
by messenger.</p>

<p>It was Chang An who placed the mirror
above the door of Kuei Ping&#8217;s room, hoping
that it would change the evil that had entered
the house into real happiness. It was she who
procured the blue papers to paste upon the
entrance gateway announcing a death within
the compound. It was she who tied about the
neck of the deceased child two wisps of cotton
wool in order that he might bear away the
misfortune of the family and save it from a
too numerous brood of girl children.</p>

<p>Chia Sung Lien, fearing that this may have
been a frustrated attempt by his younger
son to come to the aid of his family by re-entering
the world through the body of the
child, returned with the messenger to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sure that the soul be given the most careful
attention, and that the burial rites be attended
with more elaboration than usual for
a baby.</p>

<p>To Kuei Ping the weeks and months that
followed were one long weary night-mare.
By day she haggled with tradesman and food-shop
keepers over the price of a bit of cloth
for garments for Bo Te, over shrimp for
soup or vegetables and rice for food. At
night she lay shivering under the coverlets,
listening to the restless tossing of her husband,
kept awake by her own thoughts and
his loud breathing.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang sank lower and lower into the
lethargy of opium smoking until one day he
returned home to announce that the British
consul had no more work for him that
season. He no longer strove to hide the use
of the drug from her, his only desire was to
get it. Day after day he sat dreaming his
colorless dreams while she struggled with the
problem of keeping a roof over their heads,
one by one pawning their possessions until
little save the bare walls remained.</p>

<p>These walls, closing in upon her daily, became
menacing shadows at night. Bitterly
she condemned her own blindness in believing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that she had hoped to find freedom in this
way.</p>

<p>Thus the poison of the poppy stilled into
pleasantness the dreams of Fuh Tang and
the poison of selfish despair did its work
upon the heart of Kuei Ping.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the winds grew colder and
winter came upon them.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">KUEI PING, struggling against the sense
of walls that shut her off from life and
any understanding of it, spoke quick words of
rebellion when Chang An urged upon her a
more frequent attendance at the temple of
Buddha. Borne in upon the heart of Kuei
Ping came a desire to pierce through and beyond
the walls that menaced her, to force her
way through the shadowy darkness she could
no longer tolerate and find the way to the
light of which Miss Porter had spoken in
early morning chapel long ago.</p>

<p>In her earlier times of need she had instinctively
turned to worship of the Merciful
One, but now she could force her blinding
eyes to see nothing save the smirking smile on
the face of the lacquer god. The routine of
prayers seemed but a mockery; the burning
of incense faggots before the fat squatting
creature but added to the ugliness of his already
over-smoked and oily figure. Peace
she no longer brought upon herself in the
temple, because peace was no longer what
she wanted.</p>

<p>Out and beyond herself and all of the
women of her race she wanted to go, out to
find and serve that God whom she had heard
called the God of Life and of Light. Turning
through her slender book of translations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
from the western Bible she marked, as she
read, all the phrases which called her out to
service, marked them until they stood in
bold relief upon the pages overshadowing
with their prominence all the other words.</p>

<p>Little Bo Te played unheeded at her feet.
Heavier and heavier upon her husband sank
the evils of consumption, and it was to his
long slender pipe he turned feverishly for
relief from pain and doubt.</p>

<p>Unlit, the candles of the house furnished
no glow for those who dwelt within.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">KUEI PING made her preparations for
departure carefully and quietly. She
put into the parcel of clothing only the barest
necessities, leaving the warmer garments and
her dowry pearls, which she had still clung
to even when everything else of value had
been sacrificed for the use of the others of
her household. She made sure that there was
a fair supply of rice in the house and that
Chang An had prepared some in readiness
for the morning meal. She wrote a short
note telling of her departure. Then she
steeled her heart against entering the room
where her husband and little son lay sleeping.
It was better thus, she told herself, that she
should go away in the night without any fuss
or staying of steps. She knew that she must
go if she was to find the truth for which she
sought, and the desire to find it was the controlling
motive of her life. What she had
left of material things would last until the
news of her departure reached the Chia compound.
Then they would call Fuh Tang back
with eager voices to the ease and plenty of his
family, and he would take the little son with
him. Kuei Ping felt that it was right that he
should, but she knew that if she was to hold to
that resolution she must not enter the room
for one last look at the sleeping boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>It was night, the second time in her life
that she walked through the city streets alone,
but she felt no fear. They led her to freedom.
As she passed from the dusty courtyard
and through innumerable hutungs on the
outer side of grey walls, she was filled with
a longing to tell the women shut within those
walls of what she had learned and why she
went. Lanterns hung at gateways threw out
feeble rays of light along the narrow passageways.
Turning into Hatamen Street she
found a sleepy chair-bearer who carried her
out to one of the farther city gates. There
she dismissed him, for she sought peace and
quiet in which to prepare for her new life of
service. Shut within the walls of her home
she could make no plans. A guard lay asleep
at one of the gateways leading to the top of
the city wall. She passed by him unnoticed
and found a secluded spot on beyond an overlooking
watch tower.</p>

<p>Here in the quiet above the city she prayed,
seeking for knowledge. A gentle dew
seemed to moisten the parched earth as she
waited. Then there came the hush of nature
that precedes dawn. A faint touch of gold
appeared in the sky behind the purple
western hills. The gold was shot with rays
of flame color that melted into warm amber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
which became softened around the edges with
lavender and wisteria shades; then in the
ever-changing heavens amid the glory of
color rose the sun, complete in its magnificence,
giving light unto the entire world.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping stilled her prayer to gaze in
wonder at the beauty of the sunrise and then
to look down upon the city as it roused itself
for the tasks of the day. What she saw were
but familiar things in a new light. She saw
an old man taking down the shutters from his
shop. She saw the dark lurking figures, the
petty thieves and marauders of the night,
slink away through side alleys, and in their
places came the familiar traveling restaurant
with its bowls of steaming morning broth.
She heard the restaurant carrier&#8217;s voice
mingled with the call of the hucksters from
the country. She heard the feeble cry of a
waking baby. Over the wall in the compound
just below her she watched a little lad patting
earth about a leafless plant with his two hands
while an amah urged him in to eat his morning
rice.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping turned to her worn book to read
again the words of Jesus as He had told of
the Father to all those who had eyes to see
and ears to hear. She read of love and of
patience and of understanding for the trials<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
of others and of forgetfulness of self. Patience
and quiet which she had thought of
until now as attributes only of Buddha she saw
welded into the personality of the Son who
had come to dwell on earth that those who
sought Him might know more of his Father.
Her vague longing for knowledge and for
service became a desire to live as He had
lived, simply and lovingly sharing whatever
knowledge was trusted to her as He had
shared with those of his own household and
the small section of the world where He had
dwelt.</p>

<p>Below her within the city she saw not only
dusty walls that shut out the light, but lights
too which shone from within. She came
down from her morning of prayer no longer
crying out for freedom. Freedom she had
gained through forgetfulness of self. She
was filled with a deep abiding sense of joy as
she went back through the awakening streets
to her own husband and child.</p>

<p>Bo Te had crawled down from his bed and
sat in the corner of the room playing with the
broken bits of the little ivory idol Chang An
had kept hanging about his neck. He reached
out eager hands to his mother asking her to
fix it again. She held him close, a song of
happiness throbbing in her heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Fuh Tang still lay in the stupor of drugged
sleep, but as she leaned over him she saw in
his blue-lined face something of the price that
he had paid for her freedom thus far. For
the first time she saw the real contrast between
him and the handsome gallant man
who had loved her enough to break down the
walls of custom for her and sacrifice his own
career to earn her bread by daily work. She
saw him not as a destroyer of her trust, but as
the victim of circumstances which had been
too great for both of them until now. She
saw thus now because she measured their love
not by her need of him, but by his need of her.
She read, too, in the repeated calls from his
household for their return more than just the
desire to enforce old traditions. She felt
something of the weight of the household
burdens upon the tired shoulders of Madame
Chia, and the patience and understanding
which it required to keep life going on
smoothly and happily in a home. And she
knew that according to custom it was her
duty, as the wife of the eldest son of the
family, to relieve Madame Chia and to be
ready to take her place when she should be
called to the world beyond.</p>

<p>She saw her path of service within her own
small world first in ministering to those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
had need of her and then perhaps out through
them to others.</p>

<p>With an abiding peace in her heart Kuei
Ping unfolded and put back in the familiar
pigskin chests the garments she had prepared
for her pilgrimage.</p>

<p class="drop-cap2">A PROCESSION of three sedan chairs
made its way along the Big Horse
Street of Kuei Ping&#8217;s home village. It was
the time of the Feast of Lanterns. Made in
shapes of birds, and fish with great eyes, and
cocks, and little houses that spun round and
round when they were lit, some large and
some small, they decorated the shops and
hung in front of entrance ways, or dangled
from sedan chairs. Bo Te, riding with his
father in the front of the procession, cried
out in glee over each new display or shouted
in pure ecstasy over the firing of a particularly
loud bunch of firecrackers. The street
was packed with slow-moving holiday makers
and with vendors who cried their wares and
made sales in the midst of traffic, so that Fuh
Tang spoke to the chair-bearer in the lead
asking him to go through the more quiet
Street of Precious Pearls and connect with
the hutung on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Kuei Ping rode second in the home-bound
procession. Chang An, following behind,
leaned forward and raised her voice to remind
her of the day, which seemed so long
ago now, on which they had come here to buy
Kuei Ping&#8217;s dowry pearls. The street, too,
had its decking in honor of the holiday, dainty
lanterns of dull gold decorated in red hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
before Wong Lui&#8217;s close-shuttered doorways,
and lovely ones shaped like bright colored
autumn leaves decorated a shop farther down
the street.</p>

<p>The chairs wound out of the Street of
Precious Pearls and on through the streets
along which Kuei Ping had passed on her
wedding day. Then she had gone in darkness,
wrapped in heavy veils, toward a life of
unfamiliar things. To-day she came through
the same streets again to the Chia compound,
conscious of joy in her coming, filled with a
deep gladness that she had a place there.
Her husband seemed to gather new strength
as they passed through ways he had known
in boyhood.</p>

<p>Chia Sung Lien with his household met
them at the gateways to the family dwelling.
Shining with happiness, the old man bade
them welcome and begged them to accept his
apology that the honorable mother could not
meet them at the doorway too, but that she
bade them come to her pavilion with haste
that she might greet them. When the formal
greetings were over Chia Sung Lien took his
little grandson about, showing him the wonders
of the courtyards, bringing out for his
delight the little secret boxes of play treasures
saved from his own boyhood, figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
carved of ivory and of ebony, coins which he
had saved from pocket-money years ago,
letting the child hold the pet birds upon their
perching sticks, showing him the purple velvet
carp and the silver and gold fish in the fish
pond, and exhibiting him to all the old servants
of the household and to all the relatives
who came to call.</p>

<p>Joy and love radiated through the vast
dwelling and were reflected in the passive
faces of all who made their home there. Kuei
Ping came to realize almost as a revelation
the gentle respect for each other and the careful
consideration of the group as a whole
which were absolutely essential to the life of
the compound. What she had at first
accepted as natural, then struggled against
as a barrier to life, she came now to see in a
truer light and to value that which was best
in it. She saw with new eyes the patience
required upon the part of Madame Chia to
keep the household running smoothly and
happily. The old woman, now no longer
able to go about, directed affairs from her
great bed, dividing duties and favors among
the daughters-in-law of the family who again
divided them among the other members of
the house.</p>

<p>Going to visit within her own girlhood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dwelling, Kuei Ping, from out of her brief
experience, came away again marvelling at
the smoothness of her grandmother&#8217;s plans,
and the care with which her mother had been
taught to carry on the family rites after Madame
Yen should go on to the life beyond.</p>

<p>Both families accepted with quiet respect
Kuei Ping&#8217;s feeling about the God in whose
service she now lived. If they felt her mistaken
they did not speak of it. The duties of
attendance upon the family altar and the
dropping of daily rice before the Kitchen God
were continued by the widow of the deceased
son. Kuei Ping came in turn to see beauty
in the regularity with which they served as
they believed, and the patience with which
they lived.</p>

<p>In the dimly lighted courtyard under the
familiar magnolia trees she walked with Fuh
Tang. His steps were slower now. On the
branches above their heads hung lanterns for
the festival, through the latticed windows of
the rooms about the court warm home lights
glowed, from the kitchen court came the
sound of servants chattering as they finished
the tasks of the day, then above the other
noises rose the shrill voice of their son. They
stayed their steps to listen. He was telling
the other children of the compound about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
courtyard in which he had lived with Father
and Mother and Chang An and an old gateman
all by himself, telling them about the
big city that is Peking. And of the wondrous
procession which he had once seen there
when Father had lifted him upon the wall
that he might get a far-away glimpse of the
Emperor with lots and lots of banners and
men going with him. They heard him say
that when he grew up he was going to be an
Emperor and ride along a golden road at the
head of a big procession. They heard him
shout that he would if he wanted to, when
the other children mocked his dream with its
impossibility. They heard Chang An bear
him away to bed.</p>

<p>Fuh Tang&#8217;s eyes twinkled with humor as he
looked down at Kuei Ping. She laughed back.
The barrier that had seemed to separate
them was down. True, the walls of the compound
that had pressed in upon their earlier
freedom were about them, but Kuei Ping saw
them now only as encircling walls of stone
and mortar.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE years that followed were but the
melting together of the pearls of Kuei
Ping&#8217;s life. They held the gems of joy and
of sorrow. She took up again the task of
learning from Madame Chia the ways of
household management, observing as carefully
as possible the honorable mother&#8217;s
wishes, coming to love her for her patience
and her ability. She went often during the
remaining days of Madame Yen&#8217;s life to the
bedside, sometimes reading to her grandmother
from the Book of Life she had received
from the West, sometimes listening
quietly as the old lady told her bits of wisdom
she had learned from her own living.</p>

<p>The second of the new years within the
compound gave to Kuei Ping a baby girl.
Fuh Tang, growing steadily weaker, brightened
with the coming of the gentle little child.
Kuei Ping watched him as he played with the
baby and let a hope grow in her heart that he
would be well again. The entire household
came to share that hope. A year passed in
which each of the days was a glorious promise
of more.</p>

<p>Then the end came suddenly in a short
spasm of suffering. When it was over Kuei
Ping could not feel that Fuh Tang was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
finished with life, but that he had passed on
where there was no more of earthly suffering.</p>

<p>The long days that followed bore their
pain of loneliness. The sleeves of his garments
hung so empty and lay so still as she
folded them away. Bo Te cried piteously for
the return of his father. Stilling his cries and
lulling to sleep the little daughter, Kuei Ping
felt herself to blame that she had wanted
freedom and perhaps had bought it with Fuh
Tang&#8217;s life. Then there came over her a
great thankfulness for what he had given her&mdash;the
right to come and go as she chose
through the compound door, two children to
guide in their wanderings beyond it, and a
love that seemed nearer now than it had since
those days when the weariness had first begun
to come upon him.</p>

<p>Her days were different from those of the
women whose homes joined hers along the
hutung only in that she had greater personal
freedom and that she sought to live by the
pattern of the life of Christ. The duties were
the same round of daily household tasks.
Time and time again she found it hard to live
as near like the Master in kindliness and love
as the women whom she knew who still worshipped
in the old familiar ways. But as her
daughter grew older she was tenfold thankful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
for the little she had learned of Christian
faith and of the place it gave to women.</p>

<p>While Kuei Ping&#8217;s children were small she
taught them, gathering about her each morning,
as her uncle had done before her, all the
children of the compound. She followed in
her lesson plans the same teaching of nature
from the plants in the garden, the same beginning
of five written characters from the
old classics each day, but to the worn book of
Rites she added the parables from the book
of Christ. A dream grew then,&mdash;to found a
home school in which all the children of the
neighborhood who would, might come and
learn not the western way of life, but the
home way enlightened by the teachings of
Jesus.</p>

<p>Almost miraculously she and her little village
passed untouched through the Boxer rebellion.
Perhaps it was their smallness that
saved them from the destroying hand of the
fanatically-crazed men who sought to save
their country as the center of the universe,
complete in itself, and to drive out all other
influences. Kuei Ping likes to think of it as
a modern miracle.</p>

<p>But the fall of the Manchus and the coming
of a Republic so cut down her means that
the little school had to be pushed back again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
into the realm of dreams after it had grown
to a reality with twenty day students. One
entire side of the home had been used for the
plan. Now only a few rooms of the compound
were Kuei Ping&#8217;s even for dwelling
quarters, for other Chia relatives came seeking
shelter. Their official incomes shaved to
a mere pittance, the fatty places in which they
had squeezed more than twice their earnings
taken away, the piteous flock did not know
what else to do.</p>

<p>It was then that Kuei Ping faced the problem
not of dividing what she had with others
but of earning for her own children their
livelihood and of preparing them to fill the
place in life which she had so blithely planned
for them. Again her thoughts turned to the
West where women knew how to do things
with which to earn money. Bo Te, now
called by his school name Kwan Wa, begged
to give up his education and to seek for work.
He had only two more years of study before
the completion of his chosen course, and as he
had been offered the opportunity of a scholarship
she refused to consider the suggestion.</p>

<p>It was then that she began to teach foreigners
Chinese. Miss Porter, to whom she
went with her problem, sent her the first two
pupils. She found two rooms in a section of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
a courtyard near enough to the mission school
for her daughter to attend classes with other
girls of her own age. The expenses of her
life were small, her group of private pupils
grew larger and as she came to earn even a
little more than she needed, this she added to
a tiny growing heap of savings. Bit by bit she
revived again the hope that when her son had
finished his education she would build her
school. As a part of this growing plan she
held as capital the string of pearls bought so
long ago. The jewels, treasured as they had
been through each period of vicissitude in her
life, had come to have an intrinsic beauty
which strengthened her desire to use them
where they would luminate the lives of
others.</p>

<p>The affairs of government rocked above
her head. She was conscious of them but
they did not shake her determination to secure
the title to a part of the old home where
her maternal grandmother had spent her life,
to be used for her school.</p>

<p>Then her little daughter fell ill of fever.
Long months of nursing made her better but
the foreign doctor urged the seashore and
Kuei Ping again delayed her school plans, and
took from her savings.</p>

<p>Kwan Wa&#8217;s marriage and an opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
to begin the school came in the same year.
His work for the year took him to Mukden
and his salary was sufficient to make
her earnings unnecessary for the family
needs.</p>

<p>He, too, shared her plan for the home
school and widened that dream to a plan
that they should build near it a church for
the worship of the Christian God whom they
sought to follow.</p>

<p>It was a joyous day when Chia Kuei Ping
at last saw the dream again a reality. No
new buildings were built. The old compound
in which her mother had lived before she was
married was large enough for a part to be
used as a dwelling and a part for classes.
Each overlapped the other so that they were
one&mdash;a home where education and living are
one and the same.</p>

<p>The plan grew more rapidly than she could
well manage alone. Then she discovered a
man and his wife, childless, followers too of
this new religion from the West but members
of another of its man-made branches, who
wished to help. They came to her to add to
her teaching staff, giving their time and their
small income to the project.</p>

<p>Again as time passed and the word of the
school and its teachings spread, she found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that her doors must be widened and her
pocketbook fattened to make possible the
needed expenditures. It was then that she
returned to the task of teaching foreigners to
speak Chinese, riding the twenty long miles
to and from her home twice a week to the
city of Peking.</p>

<p>A small inheritance came from her father&#8217;s
family and this was laid aside as the beginning
of the church she dreamed of building,
where in a place set apart those who wished
to enter might find a quiet place for communion
with God. Into this building she put
her dowry pearls, at last.</p>

<p>On her fiftieth birthday the people of her
village laid the corner stone of the new church
and even those who followed still the ways
of worship of their fathers lent their hands
to the building.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE key to new treasure is often found
in places unexpectedly near. It was
midforenoon of a day in early spring. I approached
the stuffy cubby hole, in which my
private teacher waited, with lagging steps,
struggling with the temptation to be finished
with school for the day. On Hatamen
Street a fortune teller squatted, reading fates
with his magic paraphernalia; outside of
Chen Men an old man in a lantern had
promised to teach me to paint on parchment;
there was a temple bazaar on at Lung Fa Fsu&mdash;a
dozen different allurements called. Reluctantly
I tapped upon the door several
minutes late.</p>

<p>A woman older than my former teacher
bade me enter. It is the custom in the school
where I study Mandarin, or official Chinese,
to change instructors often lest one copy too
accurately mannerisms in intonation. Perhaps
had it not been spring, or had I not been
late we would have conned over lessons for
weeks and gone no deeper behind the veil of
passive expression on either face, each of us
busy with her own thoughts while we droned
over Chinese proverbs. As it was I had seen
the official looking document laid upon the
table and the light in Chia Kuei Ping&#8217;s eyes
that told better than words the story of a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hoped for dream suddenly come true. Perhaps
she felt the need in mine. I count it
among the most precious treasures of my life
that she did not pass me by with only a drilling
on Chinese proverbs.</p>

<p>Proverbs are good, but she gave me much
more. The document she translated was the
appointment of her son to go to study railway
transportation for three years in America,
England and the continent of Europe. While
she talked, I who could understand only a few
of her words, caught something of what that
meant to her and to her people. Through
her eyes I saw burdens lifted from the necks
of millions of overladen men and women who
with their bodies now make the largest part
of the transportation service of her country.
She was not blinded to the long years before
her son&#8217;s dream of an interlacing series of
freight trains should take their place; but her
dream had been fulfilled in his opportunity.</p>

<p>The days that followed were filled with
deep joy for me. In the atmosphere of her
own home Kuei Ping let me know her daughter
and her four grandchildren. Nestled at
the foot of the western hills, where seventeen
generations of her mother&#8217;s family have
dwelt, she let me sit at her feet and listen to
life as it was lived about her. She did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
still my eager questions, but she shared with
me what she had learned from fifty-five years
of life, teaching as simply and as eagerly as
she taught the pupils of her own school.</p>

<p>Ancient trees mark cool spots of deep
green on the bare cathedral-like glory of
western hills that overlook her village. They
shelter the ancient temples in which her forefathers
and her neighbors have worshipped
for many generations. Some are falling into
decay, but all have been built with infinite
care by the hand of man. In the quiet of
early morning I have listened with Chia Kuei
Ping to the chant of services in the Llama
temple, to make which men carried pure
white marble all the way from India that
they might have a fitting dwelling place for
their gods. I have walked with her beneath
the peaceful shade of wide-spreading trees
that stretch their branches over the roof of
a temple where men and women seek through
worship of Buddha to bring blessedness to
themselves and their families. She has led
me beneath the counting board whose legend
reads &#8220;As you live so shall the evils be
marked against you,&#8221; through the noisy mart
of a Taoist temple where seekers after truth
please their gods by avoiding evil.</p>

<p>The mountains overlook, and the temples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
surround, her little school and church, the
former but a part of her ancient family dwelling,
the latter new like her religion. The trees
that surround it are but slender saplings, little
more than sprouting roots. The simple structure
of the building has no architectural
beauty to compare with the ancient temples
on the hillside. I wonder just a little at her
daring to place it there. Then from within
her dwelling comes the sound of childish
voices singing&mdash;the children who are being
taught what she has learned of life while she
goes just a little ahead, listening with the
eager heart of youth for the voice of the
Father who gave his Son that those who seek
might learn of Him. Her school is filled to
overflowing with the youth of her village.</p>

<p>Parents, too long bound by old tradition
to learn to walk in new ways, covet for their
children the luminous light that shines in the
eyes of Chia Kuei Ping.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
